    Returns an array with axes transposed.

    For a 1-D array, this returns an unchanged view of the original array, as a 
    transposed vector is simply the same vector. To convert a 1-D array into a 2-D 
    column vector, an additional dimension must be added, e.g., 
    np.atleast_2d(a).T achieves this, as does a[:, np.newaxis]. For a 2-D array, 
    this is the standard matrix transpose. For an n-D array, if axes are given, their 
    order indicates how the axes are permuted (see Examples). If axes are not 
    provided, then transpose(a).shape == a.shape[::-1].

    a : array_like
